What are CSS-Modules

https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules


webpack:
  we now split our css into two files, one for sass with global selectors
  such as boostrap col-12 (these should be global)

  The other file is all scss files that are run through css-modules to be prefixed

  ExtractTextPlugin does the ouptutting of files and we have two loaders
  one that matches *.module.scss
  one that matches (?!\.module).scss

  Anything named *.module.scss is a css module and is scoped via prefixing

Additons:
  home.module.scss (demonstrates sass-compilation and css-module pre-fixing)

Changes:
    home.component now imports a css module
